 :money_with_wings: this website is still under construction , a live currency and foreign exchange rates it was based on the yahoo exchange rate api but i changed to another free api so i dont have to use a key (limited call per month) and since i m not using a key to call the api i dont need the nodeJS part i made the call in vanilla javascript directly from the user to api.

### *Demo*
For now there is only a pc version for the website you can visit it [Here](https://mistydev.cf/CurrencyXchange)
